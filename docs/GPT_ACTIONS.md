# GPT Actions

[English](GPT_ACTIONS.md) | [简体中文](GPT_ACTIONS.zh-CN.md)

WebCodex exposes a focused OpenAPI schema for ChatGPT GPT Actions at:

```text
GET /openapi.json
```

GPT Actions and MCP share the same `ToolRuntime`; GPT Actions provides typed REST operations while MCP provides MCP framing.

## Create a GPT Action in ChatGPT

The existing `docs/assets/gpt-action-*.png` screenshots are suitable for the current deployment guide because they cover the full ChatGPT GPT builder path: open the editor, configure the GPT, add an Action, set Bearer authentication, and import the WebCodex OpenAPI schema. Treat them as UI landmarks rather than exact button-position requirements; ChatGPT may rename or move controls over time.

Use the screenshots with the checklist below:

1. **Open or create a GPT.**

   ![Open GPT editor](assets/gpt-action-1.png)

   Start from ChatGPT's GPT creation or edit flow.

2. **Enter the GPT configuration screen.**

   ![Configure GPT](assets/gpt-action-2.png)

   Confirm you are editing the GPT's configuration, not an ordinary chat.

3. **Open Actions and add an Action.**

   ![Add an Action](assets/gpt-action-3.png)

   Use the Actions section of the GPT builder; do not paste the OpenAPI schema into the GPT instructions.

4. **Configure Action authentication.**

   ![Set Action authentication](assets/gpt-action-4.png)

   Choose API key / HTTP authentication, set the auth type to **Bearer**, and paste either the shared key for quick start or a `wc_pat_xxx` personal API token for managed mode. Do not choose OAuth for the shared-key quick start. Do not use `WEBCODEX_TOKEN`, `wc_acct_xxx`, or `wc_agent_xxx`.

5. **Import the OpenAPI schema and required metadata.**

   ![Import OpenAPI schema](assets/gpt-action-5.png)

   Import or paste the schema URL:

   ```text
   https://your-domain.example/openapi.json
   ```

   Set the GPT privacy policy URL if the ChatGPT UI requires it. Use your own product or deployment privacy URL; do not put secrets in that URL.

6. Save the Action, then test a harmless discovery call such as `getRuntimeStatus`, followed by `listProjects` and a read-only project call such as `getProjectGitStatus`.
7. Use mutation tools only against a known disposable project until the GPT has been validated.

## Authentication

Configure the GPT Action with Bearer/API-key authentication in the GPT Action settings. Static bearer/API-key host auth can be used with either a shared key for quick start or a `wc_pat_xxx` token for managed mode.

For production, use a `wc_pat_xxx` personal API token for GPT Actions and MCP. The recommended explicit flow is: an administrator issues a one-time `wc_acct_xxx` account credential, then the user runs `webcodex-cli token create-local` locally to generate a `wc_pat_xxx` and register only its hash with the server.

OAuth is a separate flow. Blank OAuth client fields usually mean the host may attempt OAuth metadata discovery, dynamic client registration, or client metadata discovery; they do not become no-auth or static bearer.

Do not paste or store `WEBCODEX_TOKEN`, `wc_acct_xxx`, or `wc_agent_xxx` as a GPT Actions or MCP credential. `WEBCODEX_TOKEN` is only for server bootstrap/root/admin work, `wc_acct_xxx` is only for local token self-registration, and `wc_agent_xxx` is only for `webcodex-agent` WebSocket connectivity. Pairing/enrollment remains available as a shortcut: `webcodex-cli pairing create` creates a short-lived `wc_pair_*` code on the server/admin side, and `webcodex-cli client enroll` exchanges that code on the client side.

`?token=` is not a GPT Actions auth mechanism. It is accepted only by `/api/agents/ws` for WebSocket handshake compatibility.

GPT Actions require a public HTTPS URL for the WebCodex server.


## Token selection

Credential purpose summary:

- GPT Actions / MCP / `/api/tools/list` / `/api/tools/call`: use the shared key for quick start, or `wc_pat_xxx` for managed mode.
- Server bootstrap and emergency admin: use `WEBCODEX_TOKEN`.
- Local self-registration of PATs and agent tokens: use `wc_acct_xxx` only with `webcodex-cli token create-local` or `webcodex-cli agent-token create-local`.
- Agent connection: use `wc_agent_xxx` only in `webcodex-agent` config.

A GPT Action configured with `wc_acct_xxx` will not be able to call runtime tools and leaks the wrong secret into the wrong surface. For managed mode, generate a PAT instead:

```bash
webcodex-cli token create-local \
  --server https://your-domain.example \
  --user alice \
  --credential "$WEBCODEX_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIAL" \
  --name gpt-action \
  --scopes runtime:read,project:read,project:write,job:run
```

## Tool surface

The GPT Actions surface is intentionally smaller than the full admin API. It includes runtime, project, git, patch, file, shell/job, artifact, and session operations.

GPT Actions can expose at most 30 operations/tools. The current WebCodex OpenAPI
surface is intentionally held at 25 operations. New runtime tools should usually
remain reachable through `callRuntimeTool` instead of becoming dedicated
Actions. Chunked artifact upload tools (`artifact_upload_begin`,
`artifact_upload_chunk`, `artifact_upload_finish`, `artifact_upload_abort`) are
not dedicated GPT Action operations; call them through `callRuntimeTool`.
Compatibility edit tools (`replace_in_file`, `write_project_file`) are also
runtime-only compatibility paths. Use them through `callRuntimeTool` when
needed; source editing should prefer `replace_line_range`, `insert_at_line`,
`delete_line_range`, `apply_text_edits`, or `apply_patch_checked`.

Legacy `/api/codex/*` routes are not part of the GPT Actions schema. New GPT
workflows should use the dedicated `/api/projects/*` Actions or
`callRuntimeTool`.

It does not expose user, API-token, agent-token, pairing/enrollment, setup, doctor, npm, server management, or audit endpoints such as:

```text
/api/users/create
/api/tokens/create
/api/agent-tokens/create
/api/pairing/create
/api/pairing/enroll
/api/audit/sessions
```

Use `webcodex-cli` for those management tasks.

After deploying a server/agent/runtime build that changes tool schemas, refresh
the GPT Action schema from `/openapi.json`. Then test discovery and read-only
runtime calls before any mutation: `getRuntimeStatus`, `callRuntimeTool` with
`tool_manifest`, and read-only `show_changes` against a safe test project. Full
`listRuntimeTools` includes expanded schemas and may be too large for GPT
Actions; use it mainly for schema debugging. For focused discovery, call
`listRuntimeTools` with `summary_only=true` plus `category`, `features`, or
`limit`, or use `callRuntimeTool` with `tool_manifest`. The current runtime
scale is roughly 66 tools; the size issue is full schema/metadata expansion,
not tool system sprawl.

`tool_manifest` is the recommended GPT Action discovery call for accepted
flattened arguments. Each compact tool entry includes
`accepted_flattened_args` and `deprecated_or_unsupported_args` without returning
full input/output schemas. `tool_manifest` itself accepts flattened top-level
`category`, `include_recommended_flows`, and `include_risk_summary`. Focused
`list_tools` accepts flattened `summary_only`, `category`, `features`, and
`limit`.

When `tool_manifest_limit` or `limit` is supplied, `truncated=true` means the
caller asked WebCodex to bound the response. That is normal bounded output, not
`ResponseTooLarge`. Smoke and acceptance scripts should check whether a limit
was explicit, compare `returned_count` with `total_count`, and prefer
`truncation_reason` / `limit_applied` when those fields are present. Do not fail
only because `truncated=true`.

`runtime_status` exposes the current permission profile in `output.permissions`.
The self-hosted development default is `policy="dev_auto_approve"`,
`auto_approve=true`, and `human_approval_required=false`. This only auto-approves
high-risk tools after hard checks have passed; it does not bypass auth, OAuth
scope policy, session guards, project/session mismatch checks, path safety,
sensitive-path denial, or agent/project policy. A future release-oriented profile
should switch to `require_approval` for human approval.

For smoke project selection, call `listProjects` and prefer projects whose
`capabilities.recommended_for_smoke` is `true` inside `output.projects`. The
response shape is `{count, projects, recommended_for_smoke}`. For git smoke,
require `capabilities.git_available=true`; `agent:special:test-mcp` may be safe
for basic smoke but is not necessarily git-backed.

## Recommended flow

For coding tasks, use the deterministic coding-loop tools through generic
`callRuntimeTool`; they are runtime tools, not dedicated GPT Action operations.
GPT Actions should pass tool arguments as flattened top-level fields when
calling `callRuntimeTool`.

1. Call `callRuntimeTool` with `start_coding_task`, `project`, and a short
   `title`; keep the returned explicit `session_id`. It accepts flattened
   `include_tool_manifest`, `include_runtime_status`, `compact_startup`,
   `include_git`, `include_recent_commits`, `include_rules`, `bind_current`,
   `tool_manifest_categories`, and `tool_manifest_limit`. For startup, prefer
   bounded manifest categories such as `workflow`, `session`, `git`, `edit`,
   `artifact`, and `cleanup` instead of sending all tools into context. For
   MCP direct and GPT Action lightweight sanity, pass
   `include_runtime_status=true`, `compact_startup=true`,
   `include_tool_manifest=true`, and a small `tool_manifest_limit` to receive
   compact runtime observability plus bounded workflow discovery instead of the
   full `runtime_status` payload. If compact startup is not available on an
   older runtime, a small `tool_manifest_limit` is still a reasonable bounded
   discovery shape.
2. Inspect with `readProjectFile`, `searchProjectText`, and `callRuntimeTool`
   with `show_changes`.
3. For scoped source edits with known line numbers, call `replace_line_range`,
   `insert_at_line`, `delete_line_range`, or `apply_text_edits` through
   `callRuntimeTool`.
4. For broader multi-file edits, use `validateProjectPatch` first, then
   `applyProjectPatchChecked` only when the patch is intentional.
5. Validate with structured helpers first: `callRuntimeTool` with `cargo_fmt`,
   `cargo_check`, or `cargo_test`, plus `validateProjectPatch` /
   `applyProjectPatchChecked` for patch workflows.
6. Use `runProjectShellCommand` or `startProjectShellJob` only as bounded
   diagnostics/build/test fallbacks in registered projects. If an async job must
   be stopped, call `callRuntimeTool` with `tool="stop_job"`, the same
   `project`, the returned `job_id`, the explicit `session_id` when available,
   and `confirm=true`. `stop_job` is not a dedicated GPT Action operation; it
   obeys project/session job ownership boundaries and does not expose
   stdout/stderr. Treat `stopped` as a compatibility field; prefer
   `stop_effect`, `terminal`, and `terminal_pending`.
7. Review with `callRuntimeTool` using `show_changes`, `git_diff_hunks`, and
   `workspace_hygiene_check`.
8. Finish with `callRuntimeTool` using `finish_coding_task`; for cross-client or
   multi-step handoff, call `session_handoff_summary` with the explicit
   `session_id`. Pass flattened `summary_only=true` for compact smoke verdicts
   that omit recent events, command text, stdout/stderr, tails, and excerpts.
   For handoff, also pass `include_workspace=true` and `include_validation=true`.
   For finish, pass `include_hygiene=true` and `include_validation_summary=true`.

`finish_coding_task` and `session_handoff_summary` keep `active_count` for
compatibility and also return `blocking_active_count`,
`nonblocking_active_count`, `running_count`, `stop_requested_count`, and
`terminal_pending_count`. Only blocking active jobs produce
`active_jobs_present`; stop-requested jobs produce nonblocking
`jobs_terminal_pending`.

Until an aggregate verdict is present, judge compact workflow sanity from the
existing fields. PASS requires `workspace_clean=true`,
`jobs.blocking_active_count=0`, `tool_failures.unexpected_count=0`,
`tool_failures.expectation_mismatch_count=0`,
`tool_failures.unexpected_success_count=0`, and `hygiene_clean=true`. WARN covers
`validation.status=not_run`, matched expected failures only, and bounded
`truncated=true` with `truncation_reason="limit"`. FAIL covers dirty workspace,
blocking jobs, unexpected tool failures, expectation mismatches, unexpected
successes, or hygiene failure.

For non-coding tracking, `start_session` remains available through
`callRuntimeTool`. It creates a session record but does not automatically bind
future calls.

Do not use `save_project_artifact`, `artifact_upload_begin`,
`artifact_upload_chunk`, `artifact_upload_finish`, or `artifact_upload_abort` as
source-writing tools. They are for bounded project artifact transfer, not for
editing UTF-8 source files.

Codex delegation is currently hidden from GPT Actions and model-facing runtime tool discovery. Operators who want Codex should run it outside WebCodex, or wait for a future explicit opt-in feature flag.

`show_changes` is a read-only project inspection tool available through
`callRuntimeTool`. It summarizes branch/head, modified/added/deleted/renamed/
untracked files, `git diff --stat`, optional bounded hunks, simple warnings for
untracked smoke/tmp/test/anchor files, optional session activity, and suggested
next actions. Use it before summarizing a task, reviewing, or committing. It
requires `project:read` and never modifies, cleans, stages, commits, or restores
the worktree.

Tool risk, OAuth scope, session risk class, MCP annotations, and path hints now
begin from `ToolMetadata`. This is the metadata-only foundation for a later
ToolKernel/ToolProvider design; it does not change runtime dispatch, OAuth grant
management, or the existing tool API.

`callRuntimeTool` now enters the same lightweight `ToolKernel` facade used by
MCP `tools/call`. The facade performs metadata-backed OAuth scope checks,
session event recording, `ToolCall` parsing, and dispatch to the existing
`ToolRuntime` handlers. It is not a provider system; concrete tool handlers and
schemas remain unchanged.

## Session tracking

`start_session`, `start_coding_task`, `finish_coding_task`, `session_summary`,
and `session_handoff_summary` are runtime tools for task tracking and handoff.
They let a caller group later `/api/tools/call` invocations under an opaque
`wc_sess_*` id and ask which tools ran, which succeeded or failed, which project
id was supplied, which write-like paths were inferred, and which job-like calls
returned a `job_id`.

`start_session` creates a session record. It does not automatically bind future
calls as current. `start_coding_task` is the preferred coding-task entry point;
it creates a session, returns an explicit `session_id`, gathers deterministic
startup context, includes a compact `tool_manifest` by default, and defaults
`bind_current=false`. Set flattened `include_tool_manifest=false` to omit that
manifest, or pass flattened `tool_manifest_categories` and
`tool_manifest_limit` to bound compact entries while keeping
`accepted_flattened_args`. `finish_coding_task` requires an explicit
`session_id`; it does not fall back to current-session binding. Both
`finish_coding_task` and `session_handoff_summary` include a bounded `jobs`
section with active job counts, recent metadata, and warnings. That section is
for supervision only and never includes stdout/stderr, tails, excerpts, or
command text.

Start a session through the generic Action:

```json
{
  "tool": "start_session",
  "params": {
    "project": "agent:workstation:my-repo",
    "title": "implement show_changes follow-up"
  }
}
```

Pass the returned id as `recording_session_id` metadata on later generic calls
when using `params` or `arguments`:

```json
{
  "tool": "read_file",
  "recording_session_id": "wc_sess_example",
  "params": {
    "project": "agent:workstation:my-repo",
    "path": "src/mcp.rs",
    "start_line": 1,
    "limit": 20
  }
}
```

Then summarize it directly, or pass the same id to `show_changes` so the git
state and session activity are returned together:

```json
{
  "tool": "show_changes",
  "params": {
    "project": "agent:workstation:my-repo",
    "session_id": "wc_sess_example",
    "include_diff": false,
    "session_event_limit": 30
  }
}
```

For `/api/tools/call`, top-level `recording_session_id` is recorder metadata
for the current generic wrapper call and is stripped before concrete tool
dispatch. Top-level `session_id` is ordinary flattened tool input when
`params`/`arguments` are absent. `params.session_id` is the `show_changes`
business argument that selects which session to summarize; those ids may be the
same or different.

The recorder is bounded. Session records, events, and messages may be persisted
and restored through the configured `sessions.json` ledger, but the ledger is
task continuity and handoff metadata rather than a complete audit log. The
recorder does not automatically modify a workspace and does not scan diffs.
Inputs and errors are redacted and bounded before storage. Current-session
bindings remain process-local in-memory state, not durable ledger state, and
may be lost on restart. For reliable long-running or cross-client workflows,
keep the explicit `session_id` and pass it as tool input or
`recording_session_id` metadata instead of relying only on current binding.
In session summaries, `policy_rejected` means a safety or policy check blocked
the request before a write. A `read_project_artifact_metadata` call with
`allow_missing=true` and `exists=false` is a successful negative assertion, not a
failed tool call.

`session_handoff_summary` is read-only and requires a business `session_id`.
It does not implicitly use the current-session binding. Its optional
`validation` section is ledger-derived and does not expose raw stdout/stderr,
excerpt fields, or `validation_output_summary`. It accepts flattened
`include_validation`, `include_workspace`, `include_checkpoints`,
`summary_only`, and `limit`.

For smoke and acceptance tests, `callRuntimeTool` accepts flattened testing
metadata: `expected_failure`, `expected_failure_kind`,
`test_expect_failure_kind`, and `assertion_name`. These fields are recorded in
the session ledger and stripped before concrete runtime tool dispatch. They do
not change authorization, permission decisions, hard guards, execution,
`command_started`, or immediate success/error output. `finish_coding_task` and
`session_handoff_summary` classify matching negative-path failures as expected
while keeping unexpected failures, expectation mismatches, and unexpected
successes visible in `tool_failures` and `suggested_next_actions`.

In GPT Actions, an expected negative path through `callRuntimeTool` may still
appear as an outer `tool_error`. This usually happens because REST
`/api/tools/call` returns HTTP 400 when the concrete runtime result has
`ToolResult.success=false`. That outer Action UX is not, by itself, a transport
failure or a session classifier failure. For smoke calls marked
`expected_failure=true`, judge the final result from the immediate payload
`failure_kind` / `error_kind`, from
`session_handoff_summary(summary_only=true).tool_failures`, and from
`finish_coding_task(summary_only=true).tool_failures`.

The `tool_failures` classifier reports separate counts for `expected_count`,
`unexpected_count`, `expectation_mismatch_count`, and
`unexpected_success_count`. Matched expected negative paths should increment the
expected bucket, not be rewritten into success. Auth failures, schema failures,
invalid JSON, unknown tools, `session_project_mismatch`,
`confirmation_required`, and other real guard or transport errors must keep
their failure semantics.

For tools that are not read-only, are destructive, or are shell/job-like, the
session ledger records bounded permission decision metadata after hard safety
checks pass. Under `dev_auto_approve`, those entries have
`status="auto_approved"` and include policy, request id, risk class, tool name,
and project id only. Read-only tools do not create permission events.
`finish_coding_task.permissions` and `session_handoff_summary.permissions`
summarize these events with deterministic counts and a bounded `recent` list,
where `approved_count` is a compatibility alias for manual approvals and
`total_approved_count` includes manual plus auto approvals. They never include
stdout/stderr, environment, tokens, secrets, raw command text, patches, file
contents, or excerpts.

## Validation summaries

Validation summaries come from session ledger events for validation-like tools:
`cargo_fmt`, `cargo_check`, `cargo_test`, `validate_patch`, and
`apply_patch_checked`. `run_shell` is not classified as validation by default.
The summary includes `status` and `reason`: no validation events yields
`status="not_run"` and `reason="no_validation_tool_invoked"`; all successes are
`passed`, all failures are `failed`, and mixed outcomes are `mixed`.

The minimal parser extracts only stable facts from safe bounded metadata, such
as Cargo severity/code/span and test summary counts. It does not infer root
causes, suggest fixes, call an LLM, use LSP, or use tree-sitter.

## Observability

`runtime_status.projects` separates `server_static`, `agent_registered`, and
`effective` counts. A missing `projects.toml` is not a runtime failure when
agent-registered projects are available; prefer `projects.effective.status` and
`projects.effective.count` for model-facing health checks.

`getRuntimeStatus` and `callRuntimeTool` with `list_agents` may show a redacted policy summary:

- `allow_raw_shell`
- `allow_cwd_anywhere`
- `allowed_roots`
- `max_timeout_secs`
- `max_output_bytes`

They must not expose tokens, env values, `Authorization` headers, full `agent.toml`, or shell `init_script` values.

`start_coding_task(include_runtime_status=true, compact_startup=true)` returns a
compact runtime summary with build version/commit/dirty state, `tools.count`,
`jobs.active_count`, `agents.summary`, and `projects.effective`,
`projects.agent_registered`, and `projects.server_static` status/severity.
It intentionally omits `tools.names`, full agent policy, `allowed_roots`, shell
profile internals, command text, stdout/stderr, env values, tokens, secrets, and
full config values. Full `start_coding_task(include_runtime_status=true)` remains
available for deeper troubleshooting and can include non-secret observability
metadata such as the public URL, tool names, agent policy summary, and allowed
roots.

## Compatibility notes

The management CLI compatibility commands `webcodex users`, `webcodex tokens`, and `webcodex agent-tokens` still work, but `webcodex-cli` is the recommended CLI for current setup and operations.

## Artifact transfer and conversation file import

Artifact transfer is a bounded project artifact transfer primitive. It is for
importing and exporting binary or external files associated with a project. It
is not the source-editing path, object storage, a gallery, or a large-file
platform.

GPT Action OpenAPI operations and MCP/runtime tools are related but not
identical. The runtime side exposes more tools, and `callRuntimeTool` is the
generic entry point for runtime-only tools. To stay under the GPT Actions
30-operation limit, WebCodex exposes exactly one dedicated conversation-file
import Action: `importConversationFilesToProject` at
`POST /api/artifacts/import`.

Use this single Action for generated images, user-uploaded files, Code Interpreter outputs, PDFs, zip archives, CSV/JSON/text files, and other supported bounded binary artifacts. The recommended path remains `importConversationFilesToProject` plus `openaiFileIdRefs`. Do not create separate dedicated GPT Actions for images, zip files, or PDFs.

Recommended generated-image flow:

1. The GPT uses built-in image generation in the current ChatGPT conversation.
2. The GPT calls `importConversationFilesToProject` with `openaiFileIdRefs`, `project`, and optionally `output_dir` such as `docs/assets` or `artifacts/imports`. If the model already has a generated image, user upload, or Code Interpreter file reference from the current conversation, it must pass that file reference as `openaiFileIdRefs`; do not call the import Action with an empty array.
3. WebCodex immediately downloads each `download_link`, validates MIME type and project-relative output paths, and saves the file under the selected agent/project directory.
4. The response returns each saved file's `source_name`, `project`, `path`, `bytes_written`, `mime_type`, and `sha256`.


Do not use shell/base64 as a fallback for large files. Calling
`save_project_artifact` through `callRuntimeTool` is only appropriate for small
binary payloads or cases where a trusted base64 string already exists; the
import Action with `openaiFileIdRefs` is the preferred path for ChatGPT
conversation files. `save_project_artifact` is not a replacement for
`write_project_file` through `callRuntimeTool` or the structured source-editing
tools.

Artifact runtime tools form the project-local read/write loop:

- `save_project_artifact` saves a bounded one-shot base64 payload into a project artifact path.
- `artifact_upload_begin` starts a bounded upload with optional `expected_bytes` and `expected_sha256` guards.
- `artifact_upload_chunk` appends one base64 chunk at the next contiguous `offset`.
- `artifact_upload_finish` verifies guards and atomically commits the temporary upload to the target path.
- `artifact_upload_abort` cleans temporary upload state when the upload fails, is cancelled, or is no longer needed, and reports `final_file_exists` without touching the final path.
- `read_project_artifact_metadata` inspects artifact metadata such as bytes, MIME type, sha256, image dimensions, and zip entry count without returning file content. Set `allow_missing=true` when verifying an expected absence.
- `read_project_artifact` is a bounded chunked read from a non-sensitive project path and returns one base64 segment plus full-file metadata.

Do not use `read_project_artifact` for large files. Prefer metadata-only inspection, targeted source reads, or external artifact transfer flows instead of returning large base64 payloads through `callRuntimeTool`.

This flow does not call the OpenAI Images API from WebCodex and therefore does not consume `gpt-image-2` API image-generation charges. The image generation happens in ChatGPT; WebCodex only imports the resulting conversation file through the GPT Actions file-passing mechanism.

Security constraints: imports are limited to at most 10 files per request and 10 MiB per file. Paths must stay inside the project root; `..`, absolute paths, `.git`, `.env*`, `*.pem`, `secrets`, `tokens`, `node_modules`, and `target` paths are rejected. `overwrite` defaults to `false`. Zip files are saved as zip files and are not automatically extracted. For smoke artifacts, use `artifacts/smoke/<name>.artifact` or `artifacts/smoke/<name>.txt`; do not use `.bin` with `application/octet-stream`.


## Chunked artifact uploads

Use chunked upload through the generic `callRuntimeTool` Action:

1. `artifact_upload_begin`
2. `artifact_upload_chunk` until all bytes are sent
3. `artifact_upload_finish`

Call `artifact_upload_abort` when an upload fails, is cancelled, or is no longer
needed.

Each `artifact_upload_chunk` payload is base64 and the decoded chunk must be at
most 64 KiB. The artifact total limit is currently 10 MiB. `offset` must be
contiguous with the bytes already received. `artifact_upload_chunk`,
`artifact_upload_finish`, and `artifact_upload_abort` must repeat the exact
`path` used by `artifact_upload_begin`; this intentionally binds `upload_id` to
the requested target artifact path. `expected_bytes` and
`expected_sha256` are optional integrity guards captured at begin time and
checked before finish commits the upload. `artifact_upload_finish` succeeds only
after the guard checks pass, then atomically commits the temporary upload to the
target project-relative path. `artifact_upload_abort` removes the temporary
upload state and returns `temp_file_removed`, `sidecar_removed`,
`final_file_touched=false`, and `final_file_exists`. Prefer this abort output
for cleanup verification; do not prove absence by intentionally causing a read
failure. Session logs do not record raw base64; they keep bounded summary fields
such as path, upload id, offsets, byte counts, and sha256 guard metadata.

## Artifact metadata and chunked content reads

For existing project artifacts, prefer `read_project_artifact_metadata` first. It returns size, sha256, MIME type, and image dimensions where available without embedding file content in the GPT Action response. For abort verification or other expected absence checks, pass `allow_missing=true`; a missing file then returns `exists=false` and `missing=true` as a successful result.

Do not read large files as one base64 response. If content is needed, call
`read_project_artifact` as a bounded chunked read: use `offset` and `length`
(default 32768 bytes, maximum 65536 bytes) and continue from `next_offset` while
`truncated` is true. The returned `content_base64` contains only the current
segment; `sha256`, `mime_type`, `file_bytes`, `offset`, `bytes_returned`,
`next_offset`, `truncated`, and `eof` describe the segment and full artifact
file. This is not an unlimited download tool.
